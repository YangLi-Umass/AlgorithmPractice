/*      A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

        The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2'
        generates the string S itself.

        The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122â€¦â€¦"

        If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:

        1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......

        and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:

        1 2	2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......

        You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.

        Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string S.

        Note: N will not exceed 100,000.

        Example 1:
        Input: 6
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.*/
